The rapid growth of new documents and multimedia news has created new challenges in pattern recognition and machine learning. The problem of handwritten digit recognition has long been an open problem in the field of pattern classification. Handwriting recognition is one of the compelling research works going on because every individual in this world has their own style of writing. It is the capability of the computer to identify and understand handwritten digits or characters automatically. The main objective of this project is to provide efficient and reliable techniques for recognition of handwritten numerals by comparing various classification models. MNIST data set is widely used for this recognition process and it has 70000 handwritten digits. This project performs the analysis of accuracies and performance measures of algorithms Support Vector Classification model (SVC), Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification model.

Data Accuracy:
Logistic Regression: 89.37%
Random Forest Classifier: 96.76%
Support Vector Machine Classifier: 98.3%
It can be clearly observed that Support Vector Machine Classifier has more
accuracy compared to Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.
